## The Prompt

I am creating a Udemy course that teaches a framework, system, or process step by step. Each step should be covered in three slides and, at the end of the course, a conclusion slide and a practical assignment should be included. Follow this exact structure for every step:

### Slide 1: Step Overview

**Header: Slide Title:**

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 300–350 connected words, written in instructor narration style)

**Section: Bullet Points:** (6–8 concise points summarizing the step's key concepts, principles, or objectives)

**Tone:** Clear, professional, and explanatory. Avoid fragmented lists in notes—use continuous connected paragraphs.

---

### Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

**Header: Slide Title:**

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 300–350 connected words showing how the model company applies this step in real operations)

**Section: Bullet Points: or Table:** (whichever suits clarity best, describing actions, roles, data, or decisions)

Ensure all examples are realistic, showing how the organization operationalizes this step.

---

### Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

**Header: Video Title: and Video Notes:**

Provide ≈ 500 connected words in instructor-style narration as if guiding students through an interactive demo or simulation of the step in practice.

Use "we" throughout (e.g., "We click here," "We review the results," "We configure this setting").

Include on-screen actions, explanations of what's being done, and reflections on why the step matters.

---

### After all steps are done:

**Add a Conclusion Slide** summarizing the entire course (≈ 350 connected words).

**Add a Final Assignment** including:
- Title (≤76 characters)
- Description (≈300 characters)
- Estimated Duration
- Detailed Instructions
- 3–5 practical Questions or Tasks
- Structured Solution (text or Word doc format)

---

## Guidelines

- Keep consistency in formatting and tone across all slides
- If I provide demo text for a step, adapt it into the Video Demo slide following the same format
- The output should look professional, teaching-ready, and aligned with Udemy's learning standards
