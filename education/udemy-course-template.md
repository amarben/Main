## The Prompt

I am creating a Udemy course that teaches a framework, system, or process step by step. The course begins with an introduction section, followed by the main content steps, and ends with a conclusion and practical assignment. Follow this exact structure:

---

## INTRODUCTION SECTION (3 Slides)

### Slide 1: Welcome Message

**Header: Slide Title:** Welcome to [Course Name]

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 200–250 connected words)

Write a warm, engaging welcome message that:
- Greets students and expresses excitement about their learning journey
- Briefly introduces the instructor's background and expertise
- Sets a positive, encouraging tone for the course
- Mentions that this is a practical, hands-on course

**Section: Bullet Points:** (4–6 points highlighting what makes this course special)

**Tone:** Warm, welcoming, and motivational.

---

### Slide 2: Course Objectives

**Header: Slide Title:** What You'll Learn

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 250–300 connected words)

Clearly articulate the learning objectives:
- What specific skills students will master
- What knowledge they will gain
- How these skills apply to real-world scenarios
- **Emphasize that this course is practical and application-focused**
- Mention that students will use a real application to apply concepts learned in each lesson

**Section: Bullet Points:** (6–8 specific, measurable learning outcomes)

**Tone:** Clear, professional, and results-oriented.

---

### Slide 3: Course Outline

**Header: Slide Title:** Course Structure

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 250–300 connected words)

Provide an overview of the course structure:
- Explain the step-by-step progression through the framework/system
- Describe how each section builds upon the previous one
- **Highlight the practical nature of the course**
- **Explain that each lesson includes hands-on application using a real-world application**
- Mention the demo videos that show the application in action
- Preview the final assignment that brings everything together

**Section: Bullet Points or Table:** (List of sections/steps with brief descriptions)

**Tone:** Organized, clear, and emphasizing practical application.

---

## MAIN CONTENT (For Each Step)

Each step should be covered in three slides following this structure:

### Slide 1: Step Overview

**Header: Slide Title:**

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 300–350 connected words, written in instructor narration style)

**Section: Bullet Points:** (6–8 concise points summarizing the step's key concepts, principles, or objectives)

**Tone:** Clear, professional, and explanatory. Avoid fragmented lists in notes—use continuous connected paragraphs.

---

### Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

**Header: Slide Title:**

**Section: Slide Notes:** (≈ 300–350 connected words showing how the model company applies this step in real operations)

**Section: Bullet Points: or Table:** (whichever suits clarity best, describing actions, roles, data, or decisions)

Ensure all examples are realistic, showing how the organization operationalizes this step.

---

### Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

**Header: Video Title: and Video Notes:**

Provide ≈ 500 connected words in instructor-style narration as if guiding students through an interactive demo or simulation of the step in practice.

Use "we" throughout (e.g., "We click here," "We review the results," "We configure this setting").

Include on-screen actions, explanations of what's being done, and reflections on why the step matters.

---

### After all steps are done:

**Add a Conclusion Slide** summarizing the entire course (≈ 350 connected words).

**Add a Final Assignment** including:
- Title (≤76 characters)
- Description (≈300 characters)
- Estimated Duration
- Detailed Instructions
- 3–5 practical Questions or Tasks
- Structured Solution (text or Word doc format)

---

## Guidelines

- Keep consistency in formatting and tone across all slides
- If I provide demo text for a step, adapt it into the Video Demo slide following the same format
- The output should look professional, teaching-ready, and aligned with Udemy's learning standards
